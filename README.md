# Pascal's Triangle & Spiral Matrix
This repository provides solutions to two LeetCode Problems:
1. [Pascal's Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/)
   - Takes an Integer input(n) and outputs the (n) rows of Pascal's Triangle
2. [Spiral Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/)
   - Takes in a 2D integer matrix input and outputs an Arraylist of integers
   - Moves in circular motion, starting from the top left most corner, moving to the right of the matrix, 
```math
  \begin{bmatrix} 
    X \\ 
    Y 
  \end{bmatrix}
```
